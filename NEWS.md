# StrathE2E2 3.2.0 

* Version 3.2.0 accompanied a review revision our manuscript to 
  Methods in Ecology and Evolution in August 2020:
  
  * The variable name for omnivorous zooplankton in the code
    changed from from 'herb' to 'omni'.

  * Two instances of return without () in internal.R removed to
    comply with new cran check requirements.

* Version 3.1.0 accompanied a pre-review revision our manuscript to 
  Methods in Ecology and Evolution in July 2020

* Version 3.1.0 has the same user-facing functionality as 3.0.0, but
  is somewhat different in the background. These changes were made
  to enable the package to pass tests for inclusion in CRAN. Version
  3.0.0 was about 15 Mb, whereas 3.1.0 is only 2.6 Mb. The main 
  differences are:

  * The example data sets which were embedded in the package in 3.0.0
    are now provided in a separate supplementary data-package. The data-package
    is download and installed from our GitLab site when example data are
    first invoked from a function, and silently present thereafter.

  * Documentation which was included in the package in 3.0.0 has been
    removed and hosted on our GitLab website. The only remaining internal
    vignette is the CheatSheet.

  * Changes to sub-folder and file names in the model parameter folder to fit
    within path-length constraints.

  * Changes to data read/write input/output conventions. Functions in
    3.1.0 do not read/write results data from/to disc unless specifically 
    requested by means of function arguments. All except plotting 
    functions always return results data objects to memory. Unless a 
    data path is provided, input/output dafaults to a temporary folder.

  * A variety of cosmetic changes to functions, but in particular changes
    to internal.R to accommodate the differences between R3.x and R4.x in
    the way that strings are read in from csv files.

# StrathE2E2 3.0.0

* Version 3.0.0 accompanied the re-submission our manuscript to Methods in
  Ecology and Evolution in May 2020, and was developed from version 2.0.0.
  The key differences were inclusion of a comprehensive testing suite based
  on the R testthat package which provides >92% code coverage. The version
  also includes a range of additional functions, and an end-to-end tidy-up
  of the code.

# StrathE2E2 2.0.0

* Version 2.0.0 accompanied submission of a manuscript to Methods in Ecology
  and Evolution in December 2019 (Heath, Speirs, Thurlbeck, Wilson, 
  StrathE2E2: an R package for modelling the dynamics of marine food webs
  and fisheries). The editors recommended resubmission after development
  and inclusion of a comprehensive testing suite.

* The release 2.0.0 was used to generate results for the report:

  post-Brexit fishery negotiations fail to reach agreement on quotas 
  and access to UK waters: EXTENDED TECHNICAL REPORT. University of 
  Strathclyde, March 2020. 136pp. https://doi.org/10.17868/71708

# StrathE2E2 1.0.0

* Version 1.0.0 was a prototype R package developed in 2018 from a set of
  inter-linked R scripts  (version 0.0.0)

# StrathE2E2 0.0.0

* Early versions build out of inter-linked R scripts rather than packaged
  functions. The most recent of these represents the precursor to the 
  StrathE2E2 package.

* NERC Marine Ecosystems Programme (MERP) version - see:
  https://www.marine-ecosystems.org.uk/Research_outcomes/Model_Interactive.
  This model fully resolved inshore and offshore horizontal 
  compartments, disaggregated the former 'birds and mammals' functional
  group into separate guilds for birds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, and
  included a dynamic representation of active migrations by fish and
  top predators. Larval stages of benthos were included, and the  
  representation of seabed sediment geochemistry was greatly
  enhanced.

* An intermediate version of the model, between the MERP version and 
  StrathE2E1. This included a prototype for the fishing fleet model, 
  a prototype method for representing seabed sediment heterogenity
  and separate inshore and offshore zone.  See:
  Heath, Wilson & Speirs (2015). Modelling the whole-ecosystem impacts
  of trawling. A study commissioned by Fisheries Innovation Scotland (FIS) 
  86pp. https://fiscot.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FIS003.pdf

* StrathE2E1 is horizontally homogeneous, with two vertical water column layers
  overlying a single homogeneous sediment layer, so inshore and offshore zones
  are not resolved. There is no fishing fleet model, so harvest rates are applied
  directly as external driving data. Birds, pinnipeds and cetaceans are bundled
  together as a combined 'bird & mammal' guild.
